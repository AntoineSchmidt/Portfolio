# JavaScript game from scratch
I recreated my favorite flash-game from scratch, using pure JavaScript/JQuery.
Using [jpexs-decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases) to extract assets (images and sounds) from the [original](https://github.com/AntoineSchmidt/Portfolio/blob/master/projects/gimmick/starrunner.swf).

For now only the first level is recreated.\
Levels can be easily edited and added to the game by creating a json file in the levels folder [more information](https://github.com/AntoineSchmidt/Portfolio/tree/master/projects/gimmick/code/levels/)
