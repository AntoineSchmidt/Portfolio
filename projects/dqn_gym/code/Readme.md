# Solving Gym environments with reinforcement learning
This project uses Python, Tensorflow and Tensorboard to solve Gym environments with double q-learning.\
The environment can be chosen by running *train.py* or *test.py* with command-line parameter 1 for Cartpole or 2 for Mountaincar.\
With *train.py* the Gym environment can be solved using e-greedy or boltzmann exporation.\
The learned model can then be tested using *test.py*.
